                    Seeing Forest is a project conceived by Robert Zhao Renhui
                    for the Singapore Pavilion at the 60th International Art
                    Exhibition of La Biennale de Venezia.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In <i>Seeing Forest</i>, Zhao offers an evocative
                    exploration of secondary forests—forests or woodland areas
                    that have regrown over land disturbed by human development.
                    Often taken over by plant and animal species introduced to
                    Singapore in the 19th century, these thresholds zones
                    between primary forests and developed urban areas offer
                    insights into a complex web of human and non-human
                    coexistence.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The patient observation of a natural world that we can never
                    fully comprehend is a hallmark of the artist Robert Zhao’s
                    work. Since 1998, under the auspices of his own fictitious
                    Institute of Critical Zoologists, Zhao’s many and varied
                    projects have served as a lens that highlights the
                    resilience of nature and the interactions that result from
                    when it intersects with human life and society. In the last
                    eight years, he has been documenting various secondary
                    forests in Singapore to capture footage of phenomena rarely
                    or never seen before. For this exhibition, the artist’s
                    accumulated observations are condensed and organized into
                    thought-provoking installations that explore the real and
                    imaginal dimensions of such a secondary forest space.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The main work is a two-channel video,
                    <i>The Owl, The Travellers, and the Cement Drain</i> (2024)
                    displaying scenes of the secondary forest: its trees;
                    animals; abandoned tents of migrant workers; birds flying in
                    to drink from a concrete drain; as well as an unstable,
                    fluctuating narrative of two human characters journeying
                    through it. In conversation with this piece is a sculptural
                    video installation <i>Trash Stratum</i> (2024) comprising
                    multiple screens that show various creatures visiting the
                    forest arranged around a deconstructed cabinet of
                    curiosities, which alludes to and destabilizes colonial
                    methods of natural history classifications. Also within this
                    structure are a number of objects that the artist found
                    during his exploration of the forest, such as old bricks and
                    bottles, referring to the presence of human histories that
                    are entangled with natural ones.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <i>Seeing Forest</i> invites audiences to experience the
                    layered complexities and realities of the world around us.
                    We see how the island of Singapore has evolved to the
                    present landscape, revealing some of the ways in which human
                    urban design influenced the natural world and how the
                    natural world responds to it. <i>Seeing Forest</i> reveals
                    how these transitional spaces can offer points of
                    intersection for history, discovery, and sustainability,
                    while suggesting that the edge of a city — especially one
                    that is so carefully planned — may be the most intense
                    frontier in existence.

                    After Venice, the exhibition will continue at the Singapore

                            and migratory birds rest on a trash bin and a broken
                            concrete drain. Remnants of military facilities from
                            the British colonial era and the Japanese
                            occupation, as well as items left behind by migrant

                            narrative of two travellers passing through the
                            forest, who speak of things seen in the forest and
                            things the forest sees.

                            and the events caused by human interventions.
                            Through this, the artist prompts us to reimagine
                            these forests, which are continually shaped and
                            erased by urban expansion, as a mutable space of
                            possibility where the boundaries between human and
                            non-human, and native and foreign are dismantled.

                        A lush forest of tall trees, revealed through the fog;
                        against this backdrop, we see skyscrapers, soaring even
                        higher. A bulldozer pushes a tree out of the way and its
                        crown of leaves shakes as if in a gale. Various
                        household items discarded by migrant workers who once
                        sheltered among the trees have now become watering holes
                        for owls and lizards; frogs lay their eggs there. A
                        monitor lizard drags a scavenged pig’s head through the
                        trash, washed downriver by the currents. Wild boar and
                        sambar deer follow the boundary of the forest,
                        demarcated by a road. They are shifting their habitats
                        and trajectories of movement to accommodate the shifting
                        location of the forest itself, transformed by
                        development...

                                walk through the forest. The image—reduced to
                                colors and silhouettes by the thermal
                                camera—renders their appearance even more
                                abstract. They appear lost, or perhaps they are
                                finding their way somewhere. They walk, urinate,
                                look closely at the ruins of a building, then
                                talk about the ghosts of the forest and what
                                remains after death. Then they list what exists
                                in the forest.

                                The first chapter of John Berger’s
                                <i>About Looking</i> is titled “Why Look at
                                Animals?” In it, Berger reflects on the
                                significance animals hold for humans, and how
                                mankind’s perspective on animals has changed
                                over time, inviting the reader to rethink the
                                relationship between humans and animals once
                                again. To Berger, the birth of the zoo
                                commemorated a new impossibility of natural
                                encounter between human and animal, following a
                                fundamental shift in the way humans view
                                animals. As the longstanding relationships among
                                independent human and animal life were
                                dismembered by fledgling forms of development,
                                more and more humans came to view animals almost
                                entirely as objects.<span class="sup2 supA"
                                    >2</span

                                With the advent of the modern city, humans began
                                dividing up and designing locations according to
                                the various social needs and functions. Along
                                the way, nature writ large—including
                                animals—became objects requiring management that
                                were best kept apart from prioritized human
                                activities. Humans razed forests to the ground
                                to make way for housing and building complexes,
                                then planted new trees to create parks.
                                Singapore is a country where the concept of
                                nature management was clearly articulated from
                                the earliest stages of city planning. In 1967,
                                the vision of a “Garden City” drove the creation
                                and management of green spaces within the city;
                                by 1988, the policy was reframed as “City in the
                                Garden,” ensuring the management of urban nature
                                remained a priority within the government’s
                                agenda. Of course, the island’s complex
                                relationship with nature had already been framed
                                by colonial affairs in the nineteenth century.
                                Famously, the history of Singapore’s Botanic
                                Gardens and Zoo can be traced back to Sir
                                Stamford Raffles, a British colonial
                                administrator and avid collector of flora and
                                fauna.<span class="sup3 supA">3</span>

                                As the massive destruction of the natural world
                                caused by industrialism and capitalism has come
                                to be understood as a root cause of the ongoing
                                climate emergency, ecological perspectives that
                                engage this reality are garnering more and more
                                interest. Robert Zhao Renhui, however, was
                                incorporating ecological perspectives into his
                                praxis long before such discourse became an
                                established feature in the world of contemporary
                                art. Starting in the mid-1990s, as a young
                                student curious about flora and fauna, Zhao has
                                been observing nature and its various phenomena

                                Beyond considering how to see and treat nature
                                from a human perspective, Zhao’s efforts have
                                been geared toward practicing different methods
                                of observation to better see and hear how nature
                                chooses to reveal itself—using photography,
                                video, and installation to try and unpack the
                                sheer complexity of the relationship between
                                humans and nature.

                                The primary subject of the “seeing” in
                                <i>Seeing Forest</i> is both human and nature,
                                at the same time. But how, then, to recreate
                                nature’s own act of “seeing”? Zhao’s main medium
                                is the camera, and the camera necessarily starts
                                from the position of human technology. And yet,
                                simply imagining or presenting the biological
                                gaze of animals in the name of reproducing the
                                gaze of “nature” is itself an anthropocentric
                                proposition. As such, with the caveat that any
                                exploration of the natural world’s perspective
                                is definitionally mediated by humankind, and
                                therefore interpretive, the question becomes: so
                                how, then, do we bring humans and nature face to
                                face?

                            <p>
                                The term “seeing” here includes not only the act
                                of visually perceiving or observing something,
                                but also the actions and reactions that follow
                                from such physical perception and understanding.
                                In other words, what is captured is not just the
                                “seeing” of any physical eye (be that of the
                                human or the natural world) but also the
                                observation of human interference with nature
                                (resulting from the perspective of human society
                                on nature), and how nature, in turn, reacts to
                                such interference; by observing and recording
                                both from a third-party remove, the artist seeks
                                to uncover the kinds of complex events that lead
                                to seeing as well as perspective and action.
                                These interactions, of course, are unpredictable
                                and revealed only gradually over a long period
                                of time, making them impossible to capture in
                                advance, or, indeed, illustrate in just one or
                                two short scenes. Therefore, the artist is
                                required to observe and record over the long
                                term.

                                over the long term using a range of different
                                cameras in various situations, including moments
                                from the artist’s own forest visits to captures
                                from a zoom lens used to shoot from his
                                twenty-sixth floor apartment, not to mention
                                motion and body temperature cameras he installed
                                in the forest. As most are a combination of
                                scenes shot with very little camera movement,
                                viewers are able to take their time observing
                                the movements that occur deep within each scene
                                as they unfurl against a fixed background. This
                                is video, yes, but the viewing experience has
                                the pacing of flipping through a deck of still
                                slides, generating a quiet rhythm somewhere
                                between stillness and movement. The
                                juxtaposition of the two screens, meanwhile,
                                showcases the contrast and interaction between
                                the natural world and the kind of events
                                generally caused by humans. For example, when
                                the screen on the left shows a pack of wild
                                boars passing a hill, the screen on the right
                                shows a crew of workers before they start
                                construction, surveying the same location. When
                                one side shows the forest being dug up, the
                                other shows the animals fleeing the area for
                                another part of the forest, or perhaps a
                                time-lapse of a growing plant; culled from
                                hundreds of hours of footage, these stories of
                                mutual interference between nature and human
                                society play out in a nonlinear fashion.

                                For <i>Seeing Forest</i>, Zhao zeroes in on the
                                edge where the interference and response between
                                human society and nature is most evident:
                                namely, Singapore’s secondary forests.<span

                                Secondary forests, which cover about 4 percent
                                of the island nation, are living testaments to
                                the vitality and resilience of nature, taking
                                over neglected plots of bare land where original
                                tree growth was cleared for development or
                                cultivation. Though the artist has frequented
                                these secondary forests for nearly a decade, he
                                has come to pay particular attention to the
                                changes wrought by development around the
                                Woodlands neighborhood, directly facing his
                                high-rise apartment, and the forests adjacent to
                                Gillman Barracks, where he held an artist’s
                                residency at NTU CCA, finding himself intrigued
                                by the fact that these new forms of life were
                                emerging in spaces so close to the sphere of his
                                own daily life.<span class="sup7 supA">7</span>
                                Over the course of countless visits spent
                                observing the minute details of what goes on
                                within, Zhao has found, too, that the formation
                                and transformation of these forests is
                                intertwined with the history of Singapore since
                                the nineteenth century. Note, for example, the
                                fact that so many of the plant and animal
                                species that make up the secondary forest were
                                introduced to the island relatively
                                recently.<span class="sup8 supA">8</span> See,
                                too, how the tents and detritus left behind by
                                migrant workers who once sheltered among the
                                trees of Gillman Barracks—not to mention the
                                cracked remnants of English colonial
                                waterways—are now utilized by these same
                                animals. The fact that different forms of
                                migration have so shaped the formation of this
                                forest demonstrates how secondary forests both
                                mark and manifest key connections between
                                society and nature.

                                Zhao is particularly struck that so many rare
                                birds seek out the secondary forest. The
                                secondary forest around Gillman Barracks is a
                                stopover site on established East Asia-Oceania
                                routes followed by millions of migratory birds,
                                and the artist discovers that human traces left
                                in the forest, like abandoned drain and trash
                                bins, are actually useful to the birds as they
                                rest. Along with these migratory birds, we
                                rediscover the value of the secondary forest as
                                both a space that preserves the memories of the
                                past and a space of ecological diversity where
                                native flora and fauna mix with other species
                                more recently introduced to the Singapore
                                ecosystem. To document this secondary forest,
                                currently at immediate risk of development into
                                yet more apartments and other buildings, is to
                                create an archive of an improbable place where
                                urbanization and semi-wild nature intertwine.

                                <i>Trash Stratum</i> (2024), which takes the
                                appearance of a crumbling cabinet, is an
                                anti-monumental monument set in response to the
                                combination of human history and new forest. The
                                form of the structure itself, made of stacked
                                wooden boxes, is intended to include a
                                paradoxical take on the
                                <i>Wunderkammer</i> (“Cabinet of Curiosities”)
                                method of collecting, categorizing, and
                                organizing. Many of the objects themselves are
                                empty: empty albums used to collect postcards
                                from the British Empire’s various colonies,
                                empty bottles and objects left behind by the
                                Japanese soldiers who occupied Singapore between
                                1942 and 1945 and found themselves stationed at
                                this former military installation, and broken
                                brick fragments are jumbled up in this so-called
                                cabinet alongside screens showing footage of
                                animals coming to drink from empty trash cans
                                left behind by migrant workers. These objects
                                were either collected over the course of the
                                artist’s research or are literal traces of the
                                past discovered during his explorations of the
                                forest, entangled in the exposed roots of a
                                fallen tree. Indeed, the horizontal spread of
                                the cabinet itself resembles a tree’s roots as
                                well—an intimation of the deeply tangled nature
                                of the transformations in human time and place
                                that have occurred throughout the forest’s own
                                reconstitution. Here, the secondary forest is

                                objectifies nature does not necessarily mean
                                moving away from any artificial techniques and
                                methods to try and reduce the natural world to
                                some primitive state. As Bruno Latour says,
                                “There is nothing on earth that is precisely
                                ‘natural,’”<span class="sup9 supA">9</span> and
                                indeed, considering the ostensibly “primitive”
                                state of the natural world to be an ideal of
                                harmony that humankind should strive to achieve
                                is itself a rather romantic and anthropocentric
                                interpretation. In place of such restorative
                                ecological lenses, Zhao himself appears to lean
                                more towards the viewpoint of scholars like Fred
                                Pearce, who posit that the natural world has its

                                methods, the artist’s explorations instead tend
                                to pose more fundamental questions about the
                                complex relationship between humans and nature.

                                Zhao, the many scientific hypotheses are always
                                counterpointed by many persistent unknowns. Life
                                in the secondary forest is not always friendly

                                after one actual near-death experience, when a
                                huge tree came crashing down mere inches behind
                                him— can it be called a safe space. Even behind
                                his camera lens, zooming in and out, so
                                committed to seeing all that can be seen, he
                                also always asserts that yet more still lies
                                beyond what is visible.

                                exists behind the everyday of this city so known
                                for its urban development, but that these lives
                                are in motion, dynamic; it shows us that these
                                various ac- tors spend their own life force to
                                divide up and utilize the full scope of this
                                island. And it is the very diversity of these
                                entanglements and disjunctions, as the
                                exhibition asserts, that enriches all life on

                                the importance of learning to listen with care
                                and observing closely when it comes to the
                                natural world, reaching beyond notions of
                                protecting and managing it to consider how human
                                society might fully coexist with the
                                wide-ranging and unknown life forms that are
                                already among us, or well on their way.

                                insistence on control to join the broader
                                rhythms of natural communication as another
                                participant in an interdependent network? Can

                                and drawing ever more boundaries—actually build
                                community together with bodies that are wildly

                                come; that is, if we were to commit to

                        Yong Ding Li is a conservation biologist with a keen
                        interest in the conservation of migratory species,
                        wetlands, and tropical birds. He works widely across the
                        region to develop and implement projects that protect
                        ecosystems and species, including some of the world’s
                        most threatened wildlife, including the Spoon-billed
                        Sandpiper. He has written extensively on biodiversity
                        and species conservation in the Asia-Pacific, including
                        guide books to the birds of Singapore, Malaysia, and
                        China. He is the recipient of the Society of
                        Conservation Biology’s Early Career Conservationist
                        Award of 2023. He has been friends with Robert Zhao
                        Renhui since they were sixteen, and has acted as a
                        frequent collaborator and consultant on Zhao’s projects.
                        What follows is a conversation in which they discuss
                        their friendship, their mutual influence, and the
                        significance of secondary forests in Singapore.

                                Do you remember when we first met? It was 1999,
                                the last day of secondary school. You were in
                                the academically strongest class in our level
                                and I was in the worst, so we never really spoke
                                to each other. But that day, you were running an
                                exhibition at the school library, called
                                <i>Surprised by Birds</i>, featuring your
                                drawings of birds and natural spaces in
                                Singapore. I was especially fascinated by a
                                little baby python that you had preserved in
                                alcohol in a bottle. At that time, I also had
                                preserved a python, a piece of roadkill, as well
                                as other sorts of interesting animals I picked
                                up. So, because of your preserved python, I
                                spoke to you, and we became friends. When we
                                were teenagers, we spent most of our time
                                exploring various natural spaces. At that time,
                                you were already a very serious birdwatcher, and
                                I liked taking photographs of Singapore
                                landscapes that did not look like Singapore. I
                                was also an avid collector and, like you,
                                collected taxidermy specimens. I think we had
                                conversations about the pressures of nature
                                adapting to Singapore’s urban landscapes. Most
                                of the roadkill I found were near newly
                                developed neighborhoods near secondary forests.

                                We spent a lot of time exploring natural spaces
                                that were on the edges of the city, and shared
                                information with each other. I guess we mutually
                                influenced the direction of each other’s work a
                                lot of times. I remember calling you in 2004 to
                                tell you about a wild boar piglet roadkill I
                                found on a road in Lim Chu Kang (it’s still in a
                                jar of alcohol in my old house). Six years
                                later, you wrote a research paper about the
                                population of wild boars increasing in
                                Singapore, and advocated for further research
                                and conservation management for the species. It
                                was one of those early wildlife management
                                papers as no one had written about them those
                                days. I then referenced your research in
                                <i>The Quieting and the Alarming</i> (2013), my
                                body of work about our relationships with wild
                                boars in Singapore.
                            </p>

                            <p class="convoW">
                                After that, I always kept you in the loop about
                                my projects. I think I am most inspired and
                                intrigued by the relationship you had with
                                forests. I remember that you would simply lie
                                down on the ground in the rainforest and gaze
                                straight up for hours into the canopy just to
                                look at birds. It taught me about being
                                attentive and quiet in observing nature, and I
                                had gradually learnt how to look at it as well.
                                It also helped that when I was exploring these
                                spaces that I had a nature expert who knew how
                                to identify species and knew interesting things
                                about their natural history—I myself learnt a
                                lot about identifying birds by their calls
                                through you. Did collaborating with me on my art
                                projects change your mind in any way?
                            </p>

                                Let’s see. Your work made me ponder and
                                reconsider the importance of secondary forests
                                for wildlife. In our early explorations, we did
                                spend some time in many areas of secondary
                                forests. In 1997, we went birdwatching in a
                                patch of forest near Bukit Batok Road, now
                                cleared, as well as a huge plot of reclaimed
                                land in Changi that we used to call Tanah Merah.
                                We took the bus from Tanah Merah MRT—simply
                                because of its proximity to the ferry terminal.
                                We didn’t know much about ecology, but the main
                                reason why we went there was to look at rare
                                birds that we were hoping for and had been
                                spotted by other birdwatchers.
                            </p>

                            <p class="convo-R">
                                Then I learned more about primary or old growth
                                forests like Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, and the
                                diversity of plant and animal species in these
                                places. Old growth forests eventually became the
                                focus of my nature walks, research, and
                                documentation, and I must admit that I did not
                                pay much attention to secondary woodlands
                                afterwards.

                                filled with common invasive species) got the
                                better of me. Or maybe the obsession with
                                primary forests just made me not think too much
                                about secondary forests and woodlands. I’ve
                                actually never been to Gillman forest until your
                                art projects there. First impressions were:
                                “Just another Albizia and
                                <i>simpoh air</i> [tree shrub growing on swampy
                                ground] woodland with a few Tembusu trees here
                                and there.” At that point, I didn’t know much
                                about the history that is buried under the
                                forests here of course, nor the migratory birds
                                that you have documented!

                                <span class="nameconvo">RZR</span> Yes, I
                                started exploring Gillman Forest in 2016 during
                                my residency at NTU Centre of Contemporary Art.
                                I asked you along to explore the space with you.
                                Do you remember your first impressions of the
                                forest? You said rather dismissively that I
                                wasn’t going to find anything interesting. We
                                were also attacked by a drongo that swooped down
                                to peck our heads the moment we stepped in. We
                                had to carry umbrellas to protect ourselves. For
                                the rest of the year, whenever we entered the
                                forest, this bird would swoop down to
                                attack—then it stopped. I often wonder why it
                                stopped. Romantically, I think it was because of
                                a mindset shift in me that perhaps the bird
                                sensed. It was only after one year that I came
                                to respect the forest as a home, an independent
                                entity, rather than a project space I could mine
                                for art. I was more interested in going inside
                                to understand and feel it than to make any
                                specific artwork. That was why I set up all the
                                camera traps in the forest, to know more about
                                what goes on in there when people are not
                                around.

                                Does Gillman feel any different from the rest of
                                the forests you know, after so many years?
                            </p>

                                glance. From afar, it looks like just another
                                woodland with a few tall trees sticking out!
                                Many woodlands look like that, Dover Forest,
                                Lentor, Bukit Batok forest, and elsewhere.

                                so-called invasive species like Albizias but I
                                think they are beautiful trees! Because they are
                                tall I always see them against the bare sky and
                                their lacy silhouettes are very striking.
                                Anyway, I remember you finally ventured into the
                                Gillman forest alone after I told you about the
                                rare birds that visited the drain.
                            </p>

                                <span class="nameconvo">YDL</span> I was quite
                                surprised by your camera trap images of the
                                animals that visited the drain. There were
                                migratory birds like a Von Schrenck’s Bittern,
                                the Black Bittern, and a regularly visiting
                                Japanese Sparrowhawk; pittas, thrushes. I
                                definitely did not expect to see these
                                relatively rare birds in such a small patch of
                                woodland just a few hundred meters from a busy
                                road, and with lots of walkers.
                            </p>

                            <p class="convo-R">
                                Basically, Gillman forest is one stop of
                                thousands of migratory birds on the East
                                Asian–Australasian Flyway, which millions of
                                birds use in their migration. The flyway
                                stretches from Russia to across much of
                                Southeast Asia. On the way, they stop by wetland
                                habitatsto rest and recharge. After numerous
                                visits to Bidadari, another secondary forest,
                                I’m beginning to believe that the smaller
                                forests and woodlands in Singapore, especially
                                the secondary forests, are conducive stops for
                                migratory birds. Gillman easily hosts ten to
                                twenty migratory bird species, and there are
                                probably others we have not seen. Gillman is
                                also an oasis for adventive birds from faraway
                                lands. So, Gillman is unique in that way. It is
                                more hospitable than we thought. It has a mix of
                                migratory species, foreign species that
                                originally did not belong to Singapore
                                ecosystems, but have established themselves
                                here, and native species like tree shrews—again
                                not something I expected.

                                <span class="nameconvo">RZR</span> There is a
                                sense of this ecological diversity that I am
                                trying to capture in my work. I feel that
                                secondary forests are resilient and adaptable
                                spaces for wildlife in Singapore. They absorb
                                elements from everywhere and some kind of
                                quasi-natural equilibrium is achieved. They
                                don’t discriminate against who belongs and who
                                doesn’t, and many of its spots that are most
                                conducive to wildlife—watering holes in the form
                                of abandoned dustbins and broken cement
                                drains—are actually remnants of human habitation
                                and development…
                            </p>

                            <p class="convo-R">
                                <span class="nameconvo">YDL</span> That’s a good
                                point. I have also come to realize something: in
                                Singapore, forests can retain memories much more
                                so than developed land. When apartments are
                                built over a forest land as it has recently
                                happened in Tengah, the forest is lost, most
                                certainly irreversibly so. At the same time, the
                                memories of the land and the structures that
                                existed below are also lost forever. In
                                Singapore, most secondary forests probably
                                existed over land that was once used by people
                                for something else, such as farms, plantations,
                                and even military barracks. Singapore is an
                                interesting case study. When you destroy a
                                secondary forest today, you are no longer just
                                destroying the nature that is above the ground.
                                You may well also be erasing the history that is
                                buried under it forever, and the soil. When you
                                build a block of apartments over a forest, you
                                have to dig deep to put in the foundations of
                                those buildings. You need to remove lots of
                                soil, which contains fragments of who and what
                                once lived there. And once the buildings are
                                built, you may never be able to access what lies
                                under them unless you can remove those buildings
                                one day and dig deep into the ground.
                            </p>

                                These little patches of secondary forests don’t
                                just preserve nature, rare species, and
                                ecological processes, they also inadvertently
                                preserve bits of history and memory that may
                                have been from the last century. In Gillman
                                forest, you found ceramics in the streams. In
                                the soil, you found bits of bricks, glass, and
                                other containers, which evidently came from the
                                Japanese occupation years.

                                Essentially, nature’s takeover is comparably
                                “gentle” on history. Letting nature run over a
                                landscape, as it has happened here and other
                                parts of the world, actually allows the history
                                of a place to be preserved. I fear the day that
                                Gillman is built over, because once that is
                                done, the landscape here will be changed forever
                                and what remains of the memory of this place
                                will just be documents and a few photographs in
                                the archives.

                                amazing observation. It’s something that I’ve
                                tried to capture in my video work, the feeling
                                of sedimentation and coexistence of different
                                timescales and histories. In the secondary
                                forest time is somewhat thicker than in other
                                places—there are layers upon layers of stories
                                of animals, plants, humans, and being quiet and
                                attentive might reveal something of these hidden
                                worlds. The world is much richer and more
                                mysterious than we might think.
